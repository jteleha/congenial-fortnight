            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Joel and I am currently learning to become a software developer! Initially, I graduated from Ohio University and began working in the field of pediatric behavioral health. My plan was to continue my education in healthcare until I began talking with friends and family members about the idea of becoming a web developer. I am very excited to continue enhancing my skills so that I am able to achieve this goal.</p>

            <p>Outside of working and this class, I am a big sports fan. I love spending my weekends watching football with friends and family. Especially on Sunday when I am able to travel down to Cincinnati to watch the Bengals play.  </p>

                <h3>HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor</h3>
                <p>For my first project, I was tasked with refactoring existing code for a marketing agency to make their existing website more accessible. I was provided with a small list of tasks including: fixing semantic errors in the HTML elements, ensuring the elements followed a logical structure, and creating a descriptive title element.</p>
